\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship between salary and team performance in Major League Baseball (MLB). We do this by looking at actual outcomes for MLB teams in 2021 and compare those results to optimal rosters using linear programming. Our goal is to analyze the gap between current team performance and their potential optimal performance. 

We begin with 2021 salary data for each MLB team. This data is supplemented it with each player's 2021 salary, team, position, and JEFFBAGWELL (our performance metric, abbreviated JB). Next, we seek to maximize JEFFBAGWELL for each of the 30 teams subject to salary and player position constraints, and visualize the results. 

\section{Literature Review}

The relationship between spending and performance is common in both the public baseball discourse and in the baseball community (SABR). The book \emph{Moneyball} began the baseball revolution. One example of using linear programming in baseball is \textbf{R LINEAR PROGRAMMING LINK}. Other examples of linear programming in baseball are \textbf{FIND MORE EXAMPLES}. 

\section{Methodology/Data}

\subsection{Data Cleaning}

To clean the player dataset, we first assign positions to each player. A player's position is characterized as the position they played most frequently during the season (if they played two positions an equal amount of times, their position was randomly assigned to one of the two positions). Player's with a \$0 salary or a missing salary are removed. A pitcher is classified as a Starting Pitcher (SP) if $\geq$ 50\% of their appearances were as a starter, and otherwise are classified as a Relief Pitcher (RP). Furthermore, First Basemen (1B), Second Basemen (2B), Third Basemen (3B), and Shortstops (SS) are classified as Infielders (IF). Left Fielders (LF), Center Fielders (CF), and Right Fielders (RF) are classified as Outfielders (OF). Catchers (C) and Designated Hitters (DH) are left as their own individual categories. 

\subsection{Solving the Optimization Problem}

The decision variables ($x_{i}$) are which MLB players will be selected for each team. $x_{i}$ is a binary variable that equal 1 if player \emph{i} is chosen, and 0 if they are not. The objective function is to maximize the JB for each of the 30 teams (T):
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} * JB_{i}
\end{equation} where \emph{N} is the total number of eligible players in 2021.

subject to the following constraints:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} = 25
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\forall x \in SP:  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} = 5
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\forall x \in RP:  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} = 7 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
\forall x \in CF:  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} \geq 1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
\forall x \in RF:  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} \geq 1 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
\forall x \in LF:  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} \geq 1 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
\forall x \in 2B:  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} \geq 1 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
\forall x \in 3B:  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} \geq 1
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation} 
\forall x \in 1B:  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} \geq 1 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
\forall x \in SS:  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} \geq 1 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
\forall x \in C:  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} = 2 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\forall x \in DH:  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} = 1 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
\forall x \in IF:  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} = 5 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
\forall x \in OF:  \sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} = 5
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i = 1}^{N} x_{i} * x_{salary} \leq T_{salary}
\end{equation}

Equation (2) constrains each team to have exactly 25 players. Equations (3)-(15) stipulate the number of players at each position and the total number of players allowed for grouped positions. (16) requires that each team spend no more on players than they did in the actual 2021 season.
