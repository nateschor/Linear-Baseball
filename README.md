# Linear-Baseball

Use Linear Programming to solve the following MLB optimization problem:

Objective: Based on the 2021 season, maximize each team's [Jeff Bagwell War](https://github.com/NeilPaine538/MLB-WAR-data-historical)

Constraints:
- only 1 batter allowed at each position
- each team can only spend as much as they actually spent in 2021
